Here we go again. I've started a number of blogs, and all of them have ended the same way: neglected, outdated sources of stress, unceremoniously deleted years after a final post promising to update them more frequently. Using history as a guide, it's safe to assume this one might suffer the same fate. However, this blog has something new and special going for it: an explicit *lack* of focus.

I think I have unintentionally associated all my prior writing attempts to other (more *real or important*) projects. They were supplemental; places to showcase things of actual interest. 

With some distance, I see a couple problems with this approach. First, I rarely finish what I start. Second, it couples my enjoyment of writing to the success of some other venture. I'm afraid the first problem can't be helped, but connecting the dots on the second one has led me to the conclusion that a blog can exist in service of itself.

*Renaissance Honcho* is that blog.

I don't recall exactly where that nickname came from, but it fits; I've done a bunch of things, and the only thing they all have to do with each other is the fact that I experienced them all.  I don't quite know why I have these stories or even how I got some of them, but here they are.
